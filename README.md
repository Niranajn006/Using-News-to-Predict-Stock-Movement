## Introduction
In this project, we participate in the [two-sigma competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/two-sigma-financial-news) on Kaggle. 
We used machine learning techniques to predict future stock price movement from two modalities of data â€“ textual data from news, and numerical time series data from stock market. We conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA), data cleansing, feature engineering and modelling to figure out important features for stock price prediction.

Find out more about EDA under the EDA/ directory, and modelling under model/ directory. Welcome to use these scripts as entry point to this topic or competition.
